Simple Keylogger in Python
This is a basic keylogger implemented in Python using the pynput library. The keylogger captures keystrokes and logs them to a text file, providing a simple demonstration of how keyboard events can be monitored programmatically.

Features
Logs all keystrokes to a specified text file.
Handles special keys (e.g., Backspace, Enter, Space) for better readability.
Easy to set up and run with minimal dependencies.
